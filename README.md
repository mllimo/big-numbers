# big-numbers - WIP
C++ Library designed for efficient handling of extremely large numbers.

## What big-numbers does?
Express infinite integer numbers efficiently using arithmetic and comparison operators.

## Why big-numbers is useful?
If one aims to perform operations with infinitely large numbers, this library strives to carry out these operations efficiently. 
In contrast to other libraries, numbers are not represented as text strings but rather as a vector of uint64_t numbers. This enables direct calculations 
on the numbers without the need for unnecessary conversions or operating digit by digit, as operations can be performed directly on the n digits that this data type handles.
